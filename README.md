# Personal Website and Portfolio

Hi! I am Jan - a Frontend / Fullstack developer! I love to create visually pleasing website, learn new skills, and challenge myself along the way. I am a Frontend Developer at Accenture (a global tech consultancy) and work primarily with a Large German Automotive Client at the moment. I am creating this website to have a digital presence; a place to add my creations and a hub for people to reach out if interested. 

## Code Honest
The design of this application is based on Brittany Chiang's original personal website, so credit goes to her for the sleek look and unique features. I, however, implemented the technical side of this Frontend app myself. I did not refer to her implementation which is publicly available, and rather took it on as a cloning initiative. From this it is worth mentioning that all the components in this repo are my own insofar as how they are implemented and the approach taken.
